Abstract:
    The X-ray emission of O-type stars was first discovered in the early
    days of the Einstein satellite. Since then many different surveys have
    confirmed that the ratio of X-ray to bolometric luminosity in O-type
    stars is roughly constant, but there is a paucity of studies that
    account for detailed information on spectral and wind properties of
    O-stars. Recently a significant sample of O stars within our Galaxy
    was spectroscopically identified and presented in the Galactic O-Star
    Spectroscopic Survey (GOSS). At the same time, a large high-fidelity
    catalog of X-ray sources detected by the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope
    was released. Here we present the X-ray catalog of O stars with known
    spectral types and investigate the dependence of their X-ray
    properties on spectral type as well as stellar and wind parameters.We
    find that, among the GOSS sample, 127 O-stars have a unique XMM-Newton
    source counterpart and a Gaia data release 2 (DR2) association.
    Terminal velocities are known for a subsample of 35 of these stars.We
    confirm that the X-ray luminosities of dwarf and giant O stars
    correlate with their bolometric luminosity. For the subsample of O
    stars with measure terminal velocities we find that the X-ray
    luminosities of dwarf and giant O stars also correlate with wind
    parameters. However, we find that these correlations break down for
    supergiant stars. Moreover, we show that supergiant stars are
    systematically harder in X-rays compared to giant and dwarf O-type
    stars. We find that the X-ray luminosity depends on spectral type, but
    seems to be independent of whether the stars are single or in a binary
    system. Finally, we show that the distribution of log(LX/Lbol) in our
    sample stars is non-Gaussian, with the peak of the distribution at
    log(LX/Lbol)~=-6.6.

Description:
    The spectroscopic sample of Galactic O stars, GOSS (Cat. III/274, Sota
    et al. 2014ApJS..211...10S; Maiz Apellaniz et al.
    2016ApJS..224....4M), was used to investigate, in a homogeneous and
    consistent way, the X-ray emission from O stars. We found that 127
    stars from GOSS have an unambiguous counterpart in the 3XMM-DR7
    catalog of X-ray sources and are associated to a Gaia-DR2 source.
