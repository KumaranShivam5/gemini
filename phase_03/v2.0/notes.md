In this workspace our aim is to identify how our model works with different classes
Say we want to do binary classification for these classes >
    > LMXB transiet vs LMXB non-transient
    > LMXB vs HMXB
    > Trasient LMXB vs CV
    > Quiscent LMXB vs CV

Aims
    > To develop a consolidated code , where different data files are supplied and a all in one table with categorical class labels are returned
    > Try to learn Python classes , might be better I guess

This workspace is also being used for studying feature importance
    > FInding correlation coefficient

> parameter importance refinment .via random forest classifier
> plot of feature importance for different class 

> one feature vs others
