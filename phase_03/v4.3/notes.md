* Probility output study
* Same Source different observation different classification issue
* CLuster of parameter correlation

## Probablity Output Study

For now the classification scheme is, we assign a class to a source if the output prob is more than 0.5 , but there is a fundamental problem with this approach. 0.5 prob means that next time if we predict the same source then 50 percent chances are there that the same source will be classified correctly. SO we should set a certain threshold.

### Posterior probabilities

To evaluate the perofmance of how good out netwrk is performing for certain class , we check the probability distrbution for certain class predicted class.
Density distribution of output probabilities corresponding to predicted class

> Inference

From the posterior probability distribution plot above, we see that NS curve has a steep rise about 1.0 . BH curve peaks before 1.0 and has a broader distribution. This means that 0.
Less than 80 % probability we will take as **ambiguous** case.

#### Observation

* Total Number of obs - 400
* Ttotal Ambiguous - 52
  * Total ambiguous classfication with missing model-fit params - 48
  * total ambiguous classification with model-fit params - 4
* Total wrong - 19
  * missing-model fit - 16
  * with model-fit - 3
* Ttotal correct pred - 328
  * missing model-fit : 252
  * with model fit - 76

#### Conslusion

Most likely reason for miss-classification is missing data , model fit paramseters are set to 0 , due to which they get lower importance and increases ambiguity. However as is so many cases evwen with missing parameters sources are confidently classified correctly so cant make this conclusion.

Also hardness seems to be a deciding factor , (more study needed)
